I graduated with a degree in Computer Science with Business Applications from the University of California, Riverside in June 2022.

At UCR, I did a few things:
- Former President of Cyber@UCR for 2 years [https://cyber.cs.ucr.edu/](https://cyber.cs.ucr.edu/)
- Linux Admin for 2 years for UCR's WRCCDC team
- Captain for 2 years for UCR's WRCCDC Team
- Supplemental Instructor for CS10ABC classes for 2 years
- Campus Tour Guide for the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering for 4 years

I currently work as a Software Dev Engineer but am also interested in Security.
